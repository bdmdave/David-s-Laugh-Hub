They don’t have the guts.\n\nTime flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.\n\nThe hammer started a podcast — it’s called “Nailed It.”\n\nI told the screwdriver to loosen up.\n\nThe saw quit its job — said it couldn’t handle the pressure.\n\nMy tape measure keeps lying — it always stretches the truth.\n\nThe drill didn’t get promoted.

A carrot.\n\nI told my GPS to take me somewhere fun. It drove me to the liquor store.\n\nDid you hear about the claustrophobic astronaut? He just needed a little space.\n\nNever trust atoms — they make up everything.\n\nI asked the librarian if the library had any books on paranoia. She whispered, “They’re right behind you.”\n\nSuccess is like Wi-Fi — the closer you are to the source, the stronger the connection.\n\nMy life is a construction site — still in progress.\n\nSometimes the hardest work is pretending to look busy.\n\nEvery great idea starts with “This might be stupid, but…”\n\nI don’t procrastinate — I’m just giving ideas time to marinate.\n\nDon’t count your problems. Use a calculator.\n\nI’m not clumsy — the floor just hates me.\n\nI like my coffee how I like my mornings — nonexistent.\n\nIf you think nobody cares, try missing a deadline.\n\nPatience is what you have when there are too many tabs open.\n\nWhy don’t we ever see elephants hiding in trees? Because they’re good at it.\n\nI told my shadow to back off — it’s been following me everywhere.\n\nMy mirror and I are not on speaking terms.\n\nIf life gives you lemons, sell them. Inflation’s crazy.\n\nI bought a belt that’s a clock — it’s a waist of time.\n\nWhy did the tomato blush? It saw the salad dressing.\n\nI accidentally swallowed some Scrabble tiles.
